#### Applying a neural network learning algorithm to classify plant species

This repository aims to provide a neural network that is capable of classifying
plant species based on images of their leaves.

## Neural Network

## Datasets

We'll use open and free datasets to train our learning algorithms.

So far we have tested on the following datasets:
